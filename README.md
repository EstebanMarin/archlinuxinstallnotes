for my mac 2011 I was alble to successfully install arch linux!! writing from it as we speak

There are some notes that I want to keep as I am sure that I need to repeat the process 
So first I need to check and verify the ISO
Then there was some steps done by a youtube channel that: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zb8220uUiA
the main problem I had is when choosing the booting form solved here https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd-boot
Finally I need to install the intel: intel-ucode
After that I just run the latest of this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PBqpX0_UOc
